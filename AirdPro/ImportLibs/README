This example project is bundled with the vendor DLLs in order to show you how to use them in a C# project,
but use of these DLLs in your derived works is subject to license agreements. In particular, the Thermo license
requires each developer to download MSFileReader separately and agree to the license on their site. Then you can
distribute the MSFileReader DLLs in your non-commercial binary distributions. The other licenses do not require
developers to download the DLLs separately, but you must agree to each vendor's license agreement and have your
end users agree to them as well.
